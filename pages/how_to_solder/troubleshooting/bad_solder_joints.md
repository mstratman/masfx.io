Most bad solder joints can be fixed easily by **applying more heat to reflow the joint**. Clean and tin your soldering iron, then touch the joint and watch the solder flow over the pad and the component, about 1-3 seconds, then let it cool.

If necessary, you may need to add additional solder when heating.
