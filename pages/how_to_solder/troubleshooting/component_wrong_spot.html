<p>If you misplace a component, you need to remove the wrong one, then replace it with the correct one.</p>

<h2 id="removingacomponent">Removing a Component</h2>

<p>Clean and tin your soldering iron tip, then put some extra solder on it. Use the blob of solder to
  <strong>heat up one or both pads on the misplaced component, while pulling it from the other side</strong>.

  Resistors and diodes can be lifted one lead and one pad at a time.
</p>

<p>Capacitors can be easier to remove if you use a large blob of solder to heat both pads simultaneously.</p>

<p>After removing the incorrect component, you'll now need to replace it with the correct one. The thing that makes this tricky is <strong>the pad is probably filled with solder</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Option 1 <span>(recommended)</span></h3>
    <p>For individual wires, or components with only two leads, you do not usually need to clear the solder out of the holes.</p>

    <p>Secure the PCB sideways at a right angle from the table so you can access both sides. Use blue putty to hold it, or have a friend help you if needed. Heat the pad from one side while pushing the component through the other. Do the same for the other pad.  You may need to trim the other lead fairly short to make it easier to insert.</p>

    <p>After the component is in place, reheat each joint and add a bit more solder to add flux and ensure a good bond.</p>

    <h3>Option 2</h3>


    <p>If you have a desoldering pump, you can clean out the pad first. Press in the plunger on your pump. Secure the PCB at a right angle. Heat the pad on one side, place the pump over the other, then push the button to suck solder out of the hole. You may need to do this a few times. When you have the hole cleared out  you can insert the correct component and solder it.</p>
    <p>You can also use a solder wick, which is made of braided copper wires, along with flux to remove solder. Apply flux to the braid, set it over the hole, then press your soldering iron tip into the braid to heat it up. The solder will begin to transfer to the braid. Slowly drag the braid across and off the hole and it should hopefully be clear of solder. If not, try again (or go do option 1 above).</p>
