<p>If you misplace a component, you need to remove the wrong one, then replace it with the correct one.</p>

<h2 id="removingacomponent">Removing a Component</h2>

<p>Clean and tin your soldering iron tip, then put some extra solder on it. Use the blob of solder to
  <strong>heat up one or both pads on the misplaced component, while pulling it from the other side</strong>.

  Resistors and diodes can be lifted one lead and one pad at a time.
</p>

<p>Capacitors can be easier to remove if you use a large blob of solder to heat both pads simultaneously.</p>

<p>After removing the incorrect component, you'll now need to replace it with the correct one. The thing that makes this tricky is <strong>the pad is probably filled with solder</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Option 1 <span>(recommended)</span></h3>

    <p>Secure the PCB sideways at a right angle from the table so you can access both sides. Use blue putty to hold it, or have a friend help you if needed. Heat the pad from one side while pushing the component through the other. Do the same for the other pad.  You may need to trim the other lead fairly short to make it easier to insert.</p>

    <p>After the component is in place, reheat each joint and add a bit more solder to add flux and ensure a good bond.</p>

    <h3>Option 2</h3>

    <p>If you have a desoldering pump, you can clean out the pad first. Press in the plunger on your pump. Just as "Option 1" above, secure the PCB at a right angle. Heat the pad on one side, place the pump over the other, then push the button to suck solder out of the hole. You may need to do this a few times. When you have the hole cleared out  you can insert the correct component and solder it.</p>
    <p>Some people online will recommend using a wick or braid for desoldering, but it's likely to cause you more problems than it's worth. They're fine for removing surface solder, but don't do a good job of removing solder from the inside of the hole.</p>
