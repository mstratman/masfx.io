## Solder Balls Up and Falls

If your soldering iron's tip won't accept solder, it needs to be cleaned or replaced. Wipe it firmly on a damp sponge then immediately try to coat it with solder. If it doesn't work, try again. 


If after several times you're not making any progress, it may be time to replace the tip. Alternatively you can use a special tip tinning product, or a jar of flux which will work more aggressively to remove oxidation.
