Before understanding how this circuit works, you need to learn the basics of electricity. 

Follow this great [tutorial on SparkFun that covers Voltage, Current, and Resistance](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law/all). If you're in a hurry, you can stop when you get to the section on "<em>Ohm's Law</em>."
