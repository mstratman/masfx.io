Look out <a href="/">for our new book, coming soon</a>, <em>How Guitar Pedals Work: A Conceptual Beginners Guide</em></a>. This book will walk you through core electronics concepts, schematics, component values, what each common component does, how some groups of components form common building blocks, and more.

When you've finished reading that, you'll be able to look at schematics for boost and distortion pedals and have a really good idea what's going on. On even more complex types of effects you'll be able to pick out common building blocks and sections of the circuits.

The book will give you a **conceptual** overview, but **will not go through the math** required for original design or analysis. For these advanced topics refer to the comprehensive list of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/">Electronics Tutorials</a>.
