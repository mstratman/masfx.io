<p>The internet will tell you to go out and buy a Hakko FX-888D ($105) and don't waste your time with the $8 soldering iron. If you can confidently predict you're going to build dozens of pedals I'll agree.
</p>
<p>
If, on the other hand, you're going to build only a few pedals, or aren't yet sure if you'll enjoy this hobby, you probably don't need more than the most basic tool.
</p>
<p>
But to be sure, let's articulate the differences between the $8 and $100+ soldering irons:

        <td>
          It won't make much difference for guitar pedal PCBs, but it may require a bit more patience when soldering a pad connected to a large plane of copper. If you follow this guide and learn to recognize a good solder joint, and don't apply excessive heat, you won't have any problems.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you don't learn how to properly to solder first, however, it'll be easier to burn the pads off the circuit board

        </td>
        <td>
          If you're certain you will use it very often, then you should skip the cheap iron. Otherwise it'll last much longer than a starter iron needs to.

      </tr>

        <td>
          Not if you get one like pictured on the previous page, which can take Hakko T18 tips. After building a few pedals and you're having trouble tinning your iron, just get a brand-name replacement tip.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<p>That last row is worth repeating: eventually you should replace the included tips with Hakko T18 tips. They will last much longer.

[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="note" heading="An Anecdote" %]
<p><small>When my old, name-brand iron broke down, I bought and used one of those cheap irons exclusively and excessively for over a year until it finally failed. I actually replaced it with the same one and used it for a while longer before finally switched back to a quality iron.</small></p>
<p><small>I'm certain if you follow this guide and learn to solder, and tin your tip, you will be able to build many pedals with an $8 iron before you feel the need to upgrade.</small></p>
