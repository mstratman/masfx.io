**If you bought a kit that came with solder, use it!** But if not or for future reference, here are some basic considerations.

## Lead vs. Lead-Free: 

Leaded solder is MUCH easier to work with than lead-free. An entire article could be written about this topic, but it can be summarized with: lead-free solder has the potential to cause you far more headaches with very few benefits.

I strongly recommend using **leaded solder until you have learned the fundamentals** and feel confident in your soldering ability. Even then, you will probably want to continue using leaded solder.

Your chances of success with lead-free solder, as a beginner, are greatly diminished.

## When To Use Lead-free?

Lead-free solder is great when you are mass producing consumer electronics. Most products are not recycled, so reducing the amount of lead contamination into our planet is a worthwhile effort. The amount of lead in DIY electronics, however, isn't even measurable by comparison.

Switch to lead-free solder if your hobby turns commercial, and you are having professional PCB assembly companies fabricate and assemble your boards.

## Leaded Solder Safety: 

People often think the fumes that rise while soldering have lead in them, but they do not. The fumes are from flux, and they are equally (if not more) harmful in lead-free solder. We'll touch on this soon, but for now the biggest safety consideration when working with leaded solder is to **WASH YOUR HANDS** to remove any traces of lead when you are finished. Refrain from touching your face, eating, or touching other people until you wash your hands. 

If you are soldering on a sensitive surface like a kitchen table, lay down newspapers to **protect it** from tiny bits of solder that will splash and **clean the surface well** when you are done.

## Tin/Lead Ratio:

**60/40 or 63/37** are the most popular for DIY electronics, and the difference between them is negligible. Choose whichever is cheaper or more readily available.

## Width of Solder Wire

0.031 or 0.032" (~ 0.8mm) is a good multi-purpose size.

Smaller can be used as well, but you'll have to push far more solder wire into each joint. I keep a roll of 0.6mm for SMD work, but probably wouldn't use anything narrower than this.

I don't recommend using anything larger than 0.032", though, since it will be too easy to add too much solder to joints.

## Flux Core

Solder used for electronics like DIY pedals should always have a flux core. Unless you're shopping for plumbers solder at a hardware store, though, you don't usually have to worry about this. Most solder you'll find is suitable.

Flux is critical for soldering because it removes layers of oxidation on your component and PCB pad so the solder can properly bond to the metal.

## Flux Types

<dl>
  <dt>Rosin core:</dt>
  <dd> An aggressive flux that will work well for most situations, including older, moderately corroded parts. However it leaves a thick, sticky residue that must be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol). Stronger mixes, e.g., 91%, make the job easier</dd>
  <dt>No clean:</dt>
  <dd>This is the least aggressive, and leaves less residue on the circuit board so it's often not cleaned off. This is my preferred type. If you'd like to clean it, use isopropyl alcohol just like with rosin core</dd>
  <dt>Water soluble [not recommended]</dt>
  <dd>As the name implies it is cleaned with water, so care must be taken when using water-sensitive components. This is also a very aggressive flux. Because of various problems water causes (e.g., from minerals and oxide), I don't recommend using this flux.</dd>
