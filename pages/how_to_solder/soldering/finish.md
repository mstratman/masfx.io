1. **Clean and tin your tip**! I bet you guessed this step by now. **Put some extra solder on it** then turn off your iron.
2. **Clean the flux** off your PCB. This will appear as brown spots near the solder joints. If you have a "no clean" flux this step may be optional, depending how messy it looks. Use isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) for regular rosin flux, and a toothbrush to scrub away the flux.
3. **WASH YOUR HANDS**. Remove any traces of lead before handling food, or touching your face or other people.
