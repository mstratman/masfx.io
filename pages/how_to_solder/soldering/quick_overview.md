1) **Bend the leads (or legs) at a right angle** to the body of the resistor. Put the leads through the holes in the practice area of the PCB <small>(Printed Circuit Board)</small>.
 
2) Flip the PCB over and **bend the leads outward slightly**. This will hold the resistor in place while you solder.

3) **Use blue putty** to stick the PCB to the table.

4) **Heat both the component lead and the PCB pad simultaneously, then melt solder** (and the flux in its core) into the joint, bonding the three metals together. We'll go through step in greater detail on the next page.

5) And finally **hold the leads** and use your cutters to **snip the excess free**. Cut the lead, not the solder.  If you don't hold them while cutting they will fly and create a dangerous safety hazard, particularly for your eyes.

Keep these clippings for additional soldering practice!
