Now it's time to actually start soldering!

## Step 1: Clean and Tin Your Tip

In order to get a proper bond, both the component lead and the PCB pad need to be heated, and **the only good way to transfer the heat is with a well-tinned soldering iron tip** that's wet with solder. 

So take a moment now to clean and [tin your tip](/how_to_solder/preparing_to_solder/tinning.html) again, and add a bit more solder.

## Step 2: Heat Joint

<div class="columns" markdown="1">

**Touch the pad and resistor**: Press the tip against the resistor lead and the pad on the PCB. Use a bit of pressure, but don't strain yourself. If you find the PCB moves too easily, look for something to secure it. I like to use a blu-tack putty, but get creative and use whatever you can find.

</a>

**Transfer heat: Add a bit of solder** between the tip and the component if it's not already fairly wet. This little bit of solder will act as a bridge to let the heat flow from the iron's tip to the pad and the component.

At this point **no more than 1-2 seconds** should have passed with heat applied. If it's been longer, remove the iron and let the PCB and resistor cool. Take this opportunity to clean and tin your tip again

## Step 3: Apply Solder

<div class="columns" markdown="1">

**Start adding solder** from the other side. The component's lead should be melting the solder, NOT your iron's tip.

</a>

**If you feel any resistance**, or the solder isn't being pulled across the pad and up lead, it's not hot enough. Reassess and make sure you have wet solder on the tip, and that it's touching both the pad and the component. If so, let it heat for up to 1 or 2 more seconds to see if the resistance disappears. Otherwise try cleaning your tip, tinning it again, then going back to the first step.

If there's no resistance and the solder is flowing, **keep pushing solder** into the join until you have a concave dome as shown here. Notice how the solder has completely covered the pad and has been drawn up the lead.

</a>

</div>

**2-4 seconds** should have passed since you first applied heat.

If you're taking longer than 4 seconds, STOP. Let the solder and component cool, then reapply heat and finish your joint

## Step 4: Cool and Check

<div class="columns" markdown="1">

**Don't let anything move** while the solder joint cools (3-6 seconds).

If the resistor's lead moves while it's cooling, the solder won't properly bond to it and you'll have what's called a "disturbed" or "cold joint" that doesn't conduct electricity properly.  Luckily this is easily fixed by reheating the solder and "reflowing" the joint.

To check your joint, first make sure it has a nice concave dome shape. It should be smooth and relatively shiny.  If it's not, again try reheating the joint to reflow it.

Look at the other side of the board and you should see a little bit of solder coming through the hole. If you don't, you may not have enough solder. Heat up the joint and push a bit more solder into it.

## Step 5: Clean and Tin Your Tip (again!)

Clean and [tin the tip](/how_to_solder/preparing_to_solder/tinning.html) again before you set it down. If you're going to be leaving your soldering iron for a while, **add extra solder** to the tip to keep it protected from oxidation.
