          This isn't necessarily a problem, but sometimes it masks the issue shown above where the solder bonded to the lead but not the pad.
          <br>
          <br>
To be safe, clean your soldering iron tip really well and reheat the joint. This will do two things: 1. ensure you flow the solder over the PCB pad, and 2. pull some of the solder off the joint onto your tip

          Solder bridge: solder has connected two pads, sometimes by bridging the pads themselves, or sometimes by bridging the two adjacent leads
        </td>
        <td>
          Clean your iron tip really well and reheat the solder between the two pads. Let solder flow onto your iron. If it doesn't disconnect on the first try, clean the tip and try again. It may take a few tries, each time pulling a bit more solder off the joint.

If you have any flux paste, it will help (optional).
          <br>
          <br>
Alternatively you can use desoldering tools like a pump or a braid, but these are almost never necessary.

<strong>Learn to recognize</strong> good and bad solder joints, and <strong>learn to feel the resistance</strong> when pushing solder into a joint that isn't hot enough.

Try pushing solder into a joint immediately as you apply heat, and feel for when it starts to flow.
