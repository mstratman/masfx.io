    <p>In frequenting the various forums for DIY pedal building, I've seen hundreds of failed projects due to bad soldering. Worse, since each was typically the builder's first pedal, there was a lot of disappointment and despair, not to mention wasted time and money.</p>
    <p>To help more people have an easier, gentler introduction to the hobby, I wrote this book and created
    <a class="todo-subdued" href="#" data-fancybox>the accompanying video <small>(coming soon)</small></a>
     and
    <a href="https://shop.mas-effects.com/products/soldering-practice-kit-3-led-flashlight" target="_blank">soldering practice kit</a>.
    The kit is even included for free with every MAS Effects <a target="_blank" href="https://mas-effects.com/beginner-pedal-kit">Beginner Pedal Kit</a>.</p>
    <p>When you finish this book <small>(and/or video)</small> and do the corresponding practice, <strong>you will be comfortable and proficient with a soldering iron</strong> and have a solid base of knowledge to be confident in any hobby electronics project.</p>
