If your soldering iron has a temperature setting or a power dial that shows approximate temperature, set it to **between 325째C (617째F) and 375째C (707째F)**.
If it is not adjustable, then don't worry about the temperature as long as it's a pencil type soldering iron for electronics, and NOT a gun shaped one.

Start on the lower end of the range to give yourself a little more time and leeway. As your skills improve and you speed up, increase the temperature to allow you to work more quickly.
