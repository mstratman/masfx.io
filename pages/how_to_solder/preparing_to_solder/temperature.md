If your soldering iron has a temperature setting or a power dial that shows approximate temperature, set it to **between 325°C (617°F) and 375°C (707°F)**.
If it is not adjustable, then don't worry about the temperature as long as it's a pencil type soldering iron for electronics, and NOT a gun shaped one.

Start on the lower end of the range to give yourself a little more time and leeway. As your skills improve and you speed up, increase the temperature to allow you to work more quickly.

It’s not, mostly*.
</p>

<p>
You want the iron hot enough so it can heat the component and pad, and the solder melts when contacting the component and pad (not the iron). You want to minimize the amount of time the component and pad are subjected to high heat, as well.

A good rule of thumb is:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Quicker speed, higher temperatures</li>
<li>Slower speed, lower temperatures</li>
</ul>
