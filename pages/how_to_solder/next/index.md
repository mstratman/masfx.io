How are your soldering skills now?  Do you feel comfortable and confident?

## No, I think I need more practice.

No problem, we got you covered. Still want more practice? [Order another practice kit](https://shop.mas-effects.com/products/soldering-practice-kit-3-led-flashlight) and use the code *MOREPRACTICE* at checkout **for half off**. You're getting this at-cost because it's really important that you have good solder joints before moving on to your next project.

Also stop by the [support forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects) and leave a post with any thoughts, troubles, concerns, and ideally some pics of your soldering so we can help you get ready as quickly as possible.

## I feel HIGHLY PROFICIENT with a soldering iron

Great! Now go and build something!

Our [beginner pedal kit](https://mas-effects.com/beginner-pedal-kit/) and [other DIY stuff](https://shop.mas-effects.com/collections/diy) ([like holiday ornaments](https://shop.mas-effects.com/collections/diy/products/guitar-pedal-christmas-ornament))  make fun first projects.

You can source your own parts and get a fabricated PCB from a supplier like [PedalPCB](https://www.pedalpcb.com/). Or if you're feeling very adventurous you can build completely from scratch using [perf board or etched clad](http://effectslayouts.blogspot.com/), or [strip (aka "vero") board](http://tagboardeffects.blogspot.com/). There are loads of pedal circuits arranged for these types of builds.

### Furthering Your Soldering Skills

As you build more, and more projects, you'll find yourself in some unique and challenging situations - particularly when it comes to **surface mount devices (SMD), desoldering, and repairing**. So the best thing you can do is just go out there and solder stuff in the real world.

When you eventually find yourself needing to do **surface mount (SMD)** soldering, don't be intimidated! Too many people think you need special tools but you don't! Follow my two videos below to see that you can easily work with surface mount parts with little more than the iron you've been using here.
