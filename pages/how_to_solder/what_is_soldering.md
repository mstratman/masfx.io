Soldering is bonding two or more separate metal pieces together with a filler metal, called solder.

It’s important to note that word: “*bonded*.”

You’re not just melting some solder over the joint. You are chemically modifying the surfaces of those metals to create a strong bond. Keeping this in mind will help you later when we consider good and bad solder joints.
