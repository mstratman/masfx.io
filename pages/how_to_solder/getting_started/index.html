<p>Don't want to buy the practice kit? No problem!</p>
<p>You can use <em>vero board, strip board, or proto board</em> available from any electronics parts distributer. These are prototyping circuit boards with a grid of copper pads or strips. Also pick up some resistors, wire, or other components to practice soldering to the board.</p>
