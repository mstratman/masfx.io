If you just want to get your kit built, and don't want to learn more than necessary, don't want extra tips and helpful context, choose "Quick." **Try pressing the "Quick" button below to see the content change.**

Most readers would be better served by staying with the "Comprehensive" version to get the most out of the experience. **Press "Comprehensive" to switch back**.

Some content will only display when the comprehensive guide is selected. This box is an example of that.
