    <p>A soldering iron and some solder are the main tool you'll need. We'll discuss specific recommendations in the following pages</p>

    <p>Or <em>diagonal cutters</em>, or <em>side cutters</em>, or <em>wire cutters</em>.</p>
    <p>These are for snipping the excess leads after soldering resistors, capacitors, and diodes.
    You can find these individually for a few dollars, or bundled in kits.

    <h3>Sponge</h3>
    <p>A damp (not soaked!) <strong>cellulose kitchen sponge</strong> will work great for keeping your soldering iron tip clean. To determine if it's suitable, make sure it's the type that gets hard when it dries. That's a pretty good indication it's cellulose. Bath sponges that are always soft, however, aren't going to work and will melt. </p>

    <p>Another popular option is a <strong>brass soldering sponge</strong>. These are made of tiny strips of brass that don't thermally shock your iron tip the way a damp sponge does, so it doesn't experience as much temperature drop. Usually in practice it's not a big deal, so don't worry about it yet. Plus the brass sponges tend to leave little balls of solder on your tip which can be annoying.</p>
    <p>And finally, a folded pile of <strong>damp paper towels</strong> can work great in a pinch too!</p>
