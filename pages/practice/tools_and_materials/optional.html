    <em>[MOST IMPORTANT]</em>
    This is only "optional" insomuch as you can assemble a pedal without it. But you shouldn't. Bits of solder can fly a couple feet or more, and clipped leads from components can go flying as well.

    <em>[VERY HELPFUL]</em>
    <strong>Something to hold the circuit board</strong>
    while you solder:
    Blu Tack putty (my favorite), clay, or playdoh work amazingly well. Specialized tools like "helping hands" (alligator clips on adjustable arms), a vice, etc are fine too. Get creative and work with what you have</li>
  <li><strong>Needle nose pliers</strong>: to bend leads and pull them through the circuit board more easily</li>
  <li><strong>Small fan</strong>: to blow flux fumes away from your face (in an otherwise well ventilated area) or a soldering fan with attached carbon filter to draw fumes in </li>
  <li><strong>Multimeter</strong>: any inexpensive multimeter can be useful when troubleshooting by checking for continuity between points in the circuit, as well as measuring voltages. <em>This kit is designed to make troubleshooting a very unlikely step</em></li>
  <li><strong>Solder sucker pump</strong>: if you mistakenly place a component in the wrong spot then remove it, the hole will be plugged with solder and this can be useful to clear it out. But as we'll see, <em>this isn't usually necessary</em> anyway</li>
