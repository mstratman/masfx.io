Locate the 3 buttons and **squeeze their legs gently** to bend them at a right angle to the body.  <span class="cc" markdown="1">This is optional, and will help keep the button from falling off the PCB before you solder it.</span>

**Place one of the buttons into the SW1, SW2, or SW3** spots on the PCB. <div class="cc" markdown="1">No need to worry about orientation, one direction simply won't fit, and for the other you can safely rotate it 180Â° since it is symmetric and has no polarity. </div>

<div class="cc" markdown="1">
Turn the PCB over, ensuring the button doesn't fall out. If it does, bend the legs more, or hold the button in place with putty, tape, or even just use pressure against the table.
</div>

**Solder its 4 legs** to the PCB, then **repeat** with the other two buttons.
