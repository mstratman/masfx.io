**Orientation matters for LEDs**. <span class="cc" markdown="1">They have a polarity. Current only flows through it in one direction</span>.

The longer leg, called an *anode*, goes on the positive side which is marked with a "+" on the PCB.

<div class="cc" markdown="1">
The shorter leg, called a *cathode*, goes on the negative side which is indicated on the PCB with a flat section of the LED outline. If you look closely at the LED itself, you'll find it also has a flat side which is useful for determining the polarity if its leads have been clipped.

The shorter leg, called a *cathode*, goes on the negative side which is indicated on the PCB with a flat section of the LED outline, matching the flat side of the LED body.

**Insert the LED into the D1, D2, or D3 spots** on the PCB.

**Bend its leads outward** slightly to hold it in place, just as you did with the resistors.

**Solder it into place**, taking care not to overheat it. LEDs are a type of diode, and diodes are more susceptible to damage from heat than resistors.

**Repeat** with the other two LEDs.
