The following pages cover common problems and how to fix them.

If those don't help, though, **head over to [reddit.com/r/maseffects](https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects) to post pictures** of your build and a brief description of the trouble you're having. This is the preferred and quickest way to get your problem resolved.

Other DIY pedal communities such as [r/diypedals](https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals), [diystompboxes.com](https://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/), or [freestompboxes.org](https://www.freestompboxes.org/) are great too, but you'll need to provide them with additional context like a schematic and links to the build docs.

Finally, if none of that works for you, [send an email](https://mas-effects.com/contact/).

[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="note" heading="Why Reddit?" %]
Reddit offers a more visual experience compared to traditional forums. This is perfect for sharing completed pedals, or pics of PCBs when you're having a problem. It also has built-in support for getting notified when people reply, has native mobile apps, and is free.

It's a great platform for niche communities. For example you may also enjoy: [r/diypedals](https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals), [r/guitarpedals](https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals), [r/diyelectronics](https://www.reddit.com/r/diyelectronics/), or [r/diytubes](https://www.reddit.com/r/diytubes). I DO NOT, however, recommend using its popular subreddits (i.e. anything you find on its main page, r/all, or r/popular) which are often toxic.
