Continue reading for tips on fixing common problems. If those don't help, though, head over to [reddit.com/r/maseffects](https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects) to post pictures of your build and a brief description of the trouble you're having. This is the preferred and quickest way to get your problem resolved.

Other DIY pedal communities such as [r/diypedals](https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals), [diystompboxes.com](https://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/), or [freestompboxes.org](https://www.freestompboxes.org/) are great too, but you'll need to provide them with additional context like a schematic and links to the build docs.

Finally, if none of that works for you, [send an email](https://mas-effects.com/contact/).

[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="note" heading="Why Reddit?" %]
Reddit offers a more visual experience compared to traditional forums. This is perfect for sharing completed pedals, or pics of PCBs when you're having a problem. It also has built-in support for getting notified when people reply, has native mobile apps, and is free.
It's a great platform for niche communities, for example you may also enjoy: r/diypedals, r/guitarpedals, r/diyelectronics, r/diytubes
 However I do not recommend using its popular subreddits (or r/all or r/popular) which are often toxic.
