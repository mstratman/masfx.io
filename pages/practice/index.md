This kit contains a circuit board with a practice area and spare resistors you can use to learn and practice soldering.

When you're starting to feel confident, you can solder buttons, LEDs, current limiting resistors to protect the LEDs, and a coin battery holder to turn it in to a keychain flashlight.

If you'd like to build your own DIY guitar pedal (or any other electronics), this kit will take you through the **critical first steps**.
