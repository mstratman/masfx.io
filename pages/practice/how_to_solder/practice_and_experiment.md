Solder more joints, but this time don't apply heat for long enough, or only heat the resistor lead, or only heat the pad. Experiment to see what happens.

Solder all the resistors to the circuit board and learn to recognize when the solder...

- is flowing freely, and when you feel resistance because it's not yet hot enough
- has flowed across the pad
- has flowed up the resistor lead

Or in short, **learn to recognize what a good solder joint looks *and feels* like**.

After you've soldered all the resistors, **use the clipped leads to get even more practice** if you still aren't fully comfortable. Still want more practice? [Order another practice kit](https://shop.mas-effects.com/products/soldering-practice-kit-3-led-flashlight) and use the code *MOREPRACTICE* at checkout for half off.

Now go to [reddit.com/r/maseffects](https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects) and post some pics! Whether you're feeling confident and want to show off, or not so sure: We want to see! If you have any doubts, show us your solder joints and we'll help you figure out where to go from here.
