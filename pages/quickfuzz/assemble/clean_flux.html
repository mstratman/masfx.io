If you're using solder with "no clean" flux this step is optional.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise now would be a good time to do your first cleaning. Use rubbing alcohol and an old toothbrush, a cloth, or even a paper towel to scrub the brown flux residue from the solder joints. A high concentration (e.g. 91% or higher) makes the job much quicker, but use what you have.

<p>
The important thing is to simply get the flux off your PCB. However, you may be left with a sticky and/or hazy residue from the alcohol.
</p>

<p>
This is okay, but if it bothers you here are two ways to get a perfect finish after you're done removing the flux:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Soak it in alcohol then blast it with compressed air for a quick, clean finish.</li>
  <li>Wipe with a cloth or paper towel dampened with alcohol, then dry with a clean one. You may need to repeat this several times.</li>
</ol>
