    <p><strong>Install the main PCB</strong> onto the 6 legs of the potentiometers. If they don't line up, loosen the nuts and <strong>make adjustments</strong>, then tighten them again. You may also need to bend the legs slightly to straighten them if they're crooked.
    </p>
    <p>Ensure the nuts on the potentiometers are tight and the potentiometers don't want to rotate.</p>
    <p><strong>Solder the potentiometers to the PCB</strong>.</p>
    <p>
      You'll find these
      <strong>require a bit more heat and more solder</strong>
      than the previous components.
      You don't have to adjust the iron's temperature to get more heat into the joint; instead, you'll simply hold it there for a beat longer
      <small>(e.g., 2 seconds instead of 1)</small>.

      If you don't see a good dome shape
      <small>(<a target="_blank" href="/how_to_solder/soldering/bad_joints.html">refer back to the How To Solder book</a>)</small>
      then heat up the joint and add more solder while ensuring it's flowing onto both the potentiometer leg and the PCB pad.
