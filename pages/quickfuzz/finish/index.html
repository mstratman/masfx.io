    <p>In this project we used T18 knurled shaft potentiometers and corresponding 6mm shaft T18 knobs. These were chosen because they don't require any extra tools like allen wrenches or tiny screwdrivers. With these you can simply <strong>push the knob onto it</strong>.  </p>
    <p><strong>For alignment</strong>: first twist the shaft of each potentiometer to the minimum or maximum setting. This gives you a reference when choosing the knob position.</p>

    <p>If the knob feels too loose, pull it back off and carefully and gently pry the two halves of the shaft slightly apart. Just a hair at a time. Moving it too far can snap it off.</p>

    <p>Another easy way to customize your pedal is with different knobs. Look for ones that fit T18, 6mm, knurled shaft potentiometers. <a target="_blank" href="https://lovemyswitches.com/knobs/?_bc_fsnf=1&Shaft+Type=18T+Knurled">Here are some from LoveMySwitches</a>.</p>
    <p>
    If you want to use 6.35mm (1/4") solid shaft knobs, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://lovemyswitches.com/potentiometer-adapter-sleeve-6-0mm-knurled-shaft-to-1-4-shaft-adapter/">buy adapter sleeves</a> to fit around the T18 knurled shaft.
