New pedal builders frequently do 3 things that prevent their pedal from working:

1. Mistakes or confusion with ***off-board wiring***. i.e., problems running wires to input and output jacks, to the DC power jack, and wiring up the 9-pin foot switch.  **We eliminate** this by getting rid of all the off-board wiring. Instead you have Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) to house all these parts, with convenient ribbon cables to connect them.
2. ***Bad solder joints***.  **We mitigate this with a <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.mas-effects.com/products/soldering-practice-kit-3-led-flashlight">Soldering Practice Kit</a>**, free with your pedal kit, and the <a target="_blank" href="/how_to_solder/">How To Solder</a> book, along with a step-by-step video to help you learn to make perfect solder joints. When you're finished you'll be a champion at soldering.
3. ***Components in the wrong place***.  **We mitigate this by pre-sorting** your components so you don't have to interpret resistor color stripes, or decode capacitor codes. With a step-by-step build guide and accompanying video to show you exactly where and how to place each component, follow along and you can't go wrong!
