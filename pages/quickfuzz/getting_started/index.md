The circuit is a variation of one called the "Bazz Fuss" and is a popular DIY project for its low part count and *dark*, *brutal* sound.  Its *asymmetric clipping* <small>(different levels of distortion on the positive and negative sides of the signal)</small> creates a richer sound than a simpler symmetric clipping arrangement.

Like some classic vintage fuzz pedals, it has a low input impedance that *loads* the guitar pickups, so it sounds best with your guitar plugged directly into it, at the beginning of the pedal chain.

### In Brief

For a brief description of how it works, look for these "WHAT DOES IT DO?" tip boxes while you build.

### In Detail

For a more detailed analysis, first read the <a href="/how_pedals_work/">How Pedals Work: <em>Conceptual Basics for the Absolute Beginner
</em></a> book. This will get you comfortable with the basics of electronics and the components found in this pedal.

Then to build upon this base of knowledge, refer to the [How Does It Work](/quickfuzz/how_does_it_work/) chapter at the end of the document to see how those concepts are applied to this particular circuit.
