## Reference Designators

Reference designators, which you may have noticed in the [Kit Contents section](/quickfuzz/tools_and_materials/) <small>(also frequently called a <em>Bill of Materials</em> (BOM))</small>, are a combination of letters and numbers that uniquely identify a component in the circuit. e.g. **R1** is *resistor 1*, **C32** is *capacitor 32*, and **D3** is *diode 3*. They consist of a **letter prefix** indicating the component type, and a **number** uniquely identifying a particular part in the circuit.

In guitar pedals you'll find these prefixes:

* **R**: resistor
* **C**: capacitor
* **D**: diode
* **Q**: transistor
* **U**: integrated circuit
* **SW**: switch
* **POT** or **VR**: potentiometer

A reference designator doesn't hold inherent significance. The numbers are arbitrary, and the prefixes aren't always used consistently. The important thing is that each part has its own designator that's unique to the circuit. A designator allows you to clearly communicate about a particular part between the PCB, on which you'll find the designator printed, as well as the BOM, and the schematic.

## Component Values, Units, & Prefixes

While not strictly required, it may be a good idea to <a class="todo" href="/how_pedals_work/">(coming soon) learn about component values</a>. Understanding what the numbers and symbols mean can give you a greater appreciation for how the parts are different, and will give you a head start if you decide to build more pedals after this one.

That said, with this kit and its presorted, labeled components, you can simply pick and place parts by their designators.
