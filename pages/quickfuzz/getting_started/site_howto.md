## This is an Adaptive, Interactive Book

<div class="columns" markdown="1">
There are **2 versions of this book**: *Quick*, and *Comprehensive*. You can switch between them with the buttons at the bottom of the page.

If you just want to get your kit built, and don't want to learn more than necessary, don't want extra tips and helpful context, choose "Quick." **Try pressing the "Quick" button below to see the content change.**

Most readers would be better served by staying with the "Comprehensive" version to get the most out of the experience. **Press "Comprehensive" to switch back**.

[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="note" heading="NOTE: Comprehensive Content" %]
Some content will only display when the comprehensive guide is selected. This box is an example of that.

If you want the full pedal building and learning experience, and have the time, select "Comprehensive" at the bottom of the page.

<div class="cq" markdown="1">
[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="warning" heading="Warning: Quick Content" %]
You're currently viewing the "Quick" version of this guide.

If you just want to get your pedal built, but don't need much hand-holding and don't want to learn anything, you're in the right place!

Otherwise if you prefer the full pedal building and learning experience, and have the time, select "Comprehensive" at the bottom of the page.

## Skimmable

I've tried to put all the **most important points in bold** so that you can skim this book more quickly. This may be helpful, for example, if you have quite a bit of experience already and are just trying to fill gaps in your knowledge. You can scan the bold points then decide if you already have a firm grasp of those topics or not.

For most people, on the other hand, I recommend you read the whole book. The bold text can be used to help you ensure you remember the most critical information.
