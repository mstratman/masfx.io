<p>
Individual wires are most commonly used to connect the PCB to the jacks and foot switch, but somtimes youâ€™ll find other connectors such as this ribbon cable.  Although more expensive, ribbon cables are a convenient way to keep the wiring tidy, prevent mistakes, and make the buid process quicker and easier.
</p>

<p>
The insulation is pre-cut at both ends of the included ribbon cables. Pull it off one end. Leave the other end covered to prevent accidentally bending the wires while you work.
</p>
<p>
Insert the <strong>wires into the side of the PCB with the rectangle printed on it</strong>, as shown in this illustration. If your cable has a red stripe on one side, disregard it. We're not using the stripe to signify anything so the ribbon can be inserted in either direction.
</p>
<p>
The ribbons will stick up on the same side as the rest of the components you have attached so far.
</p>
<p>
Turn the board over and <strong>solder each of the wires</strong>. Gravity should hold it in place, but if it doesn't want to sit flat, <strong>use a little blue putty from your practice kit</strong> to keep things where you want them.

<p>
The <strong>top ribbon cable</strong> carries the IN and OUT signals to/from the phone jacks, as well as the GND and VCC <small>(9V)</small> DC voltage levels to/from the power supply.
</p>
<p>The <strong>bottom ribbon cable</strong> goes to the foot switch and caries those same 4 voltages, but also the input to this main PCB <small>(FI)</small> and the output to this PCB <small>(FO)</small>. </p>

<h6 class="text-center"><em>Eliminating the #1 Source of DIY Pedal Problems</em></h6>
<p>Compared to traditional "off-board wiring" to the jacks and foot switch, these ribbon cables greatly simplify the build and remove a common source of errors. Traditionally you would <a target="_blank" href="http://tagboardeffects.blogspot.com/2012/02/offboard-wiring.html">run individual wires as shown here</a>, and painstakingly connect <em>over a dozen points</em>.</p>
