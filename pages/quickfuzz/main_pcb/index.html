<p>Diodes allow current to flow one way in a circuit. They are polarized, meaning their orientation matters.</p>

<p>Ensure the side of the diode with the <strong>stripe is over the stripe drawn on the PCB</strong>.</p>

<p>
<strong>Bend its leads</strong> just
<a href="/how_to_solder/soldering/quick_overview.html">like you did for the resistors in the practice kit</a> , insert it into the PCB, then solder.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Clip the leads</strong> SAFELY, holding them as you snip. Wear safety glasses!

    <p>
    As a general rule, you will <strong>always place a component on the side of the PCB with the silk screen label</strong> <small>(i.e., the writing printed on it)</small> for that component.
    </p>
    <p>
    The designator <small>(e.g., "D1")</small> will usually be printed, as well as an outline or other drawing to provide a visual reference. Place the component on top of this drawing.

      <strong>D1:</strong> as the signal alternates between positive and negative, this diode changes the way the transistor responds, resulting in asymmetric distortion
