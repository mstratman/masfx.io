<p>I want EVERY... SINGLE... PERSON who tries a <a href="https://mas-effects.com/beginner-pedal-kit/" target="_blank">Beginner Pedal Kit</a> to end up with a working pedal.
I've far too many sad folks whose first attempts to build a DIY guitar pedal resulted in an expensive paperweight or doorstop.
This kit is the culmination of countless considerations to give everyone a gentler, more satisfying first experience with pedal building.

<h2 id="howitworks">How it Works</h2>

<p>
  First, very important, step: <strong>Post pictures of the front and back of your practice kit</strong> to our
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects">support forum</a>.
</p>

<p>This is a wonderful opportunity to <strong>join the community</strong> of pedal builders, <strong>show off your progress</strong> from first solder joint to now, <strong>ask questions or request feedback</strong>, or just strike up a conversation!</p>

<p>
  If you or we have concerns that you're not yet proficient at soldering, no problem! You'll get there!
  We all start somewhere, and we all move at our own pace. You'll simply want to <em>practice more</em>.
</p>

<p>
  We can also provide detailed feedback and tips, and in some cases even hop on a video call with you figure out where you're having trouble.
  If you run out of space on your practice kit you can <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.mas-effects.com/products/soldering-practice-kit-3-led-flashlight">order another</a> and use the code <em>MOREPRACTICE</em> to get another kit half off <small>(at-cost)</small>. Alternatively you can practice on perf board, vero or strip board, or any other PCBs.
</p>


<p><strong>When you're ready</strong> and confident in your soldering, get started building this pedal!
</p>

[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="danger" heading="Stop: Did you post your practice kit?" %]
<p>Before starting this kit, please post pictures of both sides of your flashlight kit at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects" target="_blank">the r/maseffects forum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="gettinghelp">Getting Help</h2>

<p>
If you have any questions or problems, <strong>head over to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects" target="_blank">reddit.com/r/maseffects, our support forum</a></strong> and create a new post.
  Usually you'll want to include pictures of your build in addition to a brief description of the trouble you're having. This is the preferred and quickest way to get your problem resolved.
</p>

<p><strong>It's not just for help</strong>, though. Feel free to also post in-progress reports, show off your new pedal when it's completed, or start a discussion on anything you think other pedal builders would enjoy.</p>

<p>Other DIY pedal communities such as
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals">r/diypedals</a>,
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum">diystompboxes.com</a>,
  or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freestompboxes.org">freestompboxes.org</a>
  are great too, but you'll need to provide them with additional context like a schematic and links to the build docs.
  It'll be quicker to use our forum, but bookmark these others since they're great communities.
</p>

<p>Finally, if none of that works for you, <a target="_blank" href="https://mas-effects.com/contact">send an email</a>.</p>

[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="note" heading="Why Reddit?" %]
<p>Reddit offers a more visual experience compared to traditional forums. This is perfect for sharing completed pedals, or pics of PCBs when you're having a problem. It also has built-in support for getting notified when people reply, has native mobile apps, and is free.</p>
<p>
  It's a great platform for niche communities. For example you may also enjoy:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals">r/diypedals</a>,
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals">r/guitarpedals</a>,
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diyelectronics">r/diyelectronics</a>,
  or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diytubes">r/diytubes</a>.

  I DO NOT, however, recommend using its popular subreddits <small>(i.e. anything you find on its main page, r/all, or r/popular)</small> which are often toxic.
