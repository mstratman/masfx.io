<p>I want EVERY... SINGLE... PERSON who tries a <a href="https://mas-effects.com/beginner-pedal-kit/" target="_blank">Beginner Pedal Kit</a> to end up with a working pedal.
I've seen far too many sad folks whose first attempts to build a DIY guitar pedal resulted in an expensive paperweight or doorstop.
This kit is the culmination of countless considerations to give everyone a gentler, more satisfying first experience with pedal building.

<h2 id="howitworks">How it Works</h2>

<p>
  First, very important, step: <strong>Post pictures of the front and back of your practice kit</strong> to our
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects">support forum</a>.
</p>

<p>This is a wonderful opportunity to <strong>join the community</strong> of pedal builders, <strong>show off your progress</strong> from first solder joint to now, <strong>ask questions or request feedback</strong>, or just strike up a conversation!</p>

<p>
  If you or we have concerns that you're not yet proficient at soldering, no problem! You'll get there!
  We all start somewhere, and we all move at our own pace. You'll simply want to <em>practice more</em>.
</p>

<p>
  We can also provide detailed feedback and tips, and in some cases even hop on a video call with you figure out where you're having trouble.
  If you run out of space on your practice kit you can <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.mas-effects.com/products/soldering-practice-kit-3-led-flashlight">order another</a> and use the code <em>MOREPRACTICE</em> to get another kit half off <small>(at-cost)</small>. Alternatively you can practice on perf board, vero or strip board, or any other PCBs.
</p>

<p><strong>When you're ready</strong> and confident in your soldering, get started building this pedal!
</p>

<p>As you build, if any problems come up we will work with you until it's resolved. If you damage any parts we will replace them for their cost (no markup) plus shipping. Rather than replace an entire kit, we'll piece together whatever you need.</p>

[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="danger" heading="Stop: Did you post your practice kit?" %]
<p>Before starting this kit, please post pictures of both sides of your flashlight kit at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects" target="_blank">the r/maseffects forum</a>.</p>
