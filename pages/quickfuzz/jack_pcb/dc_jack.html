<p>
By convention, pedals use a 2.1mm barrel connector for power, with a center negative supply.
</p>

<p>
Getting the polarity correct when wiring jacks is often a point of confusion and failure for many newcomers to DIY pedal building. Luckily, it's not a concern for this kit since the PCB takes care of it for you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Insert the DC jack into the PCB and solder it</strong> into place. The holes are spaced to provide enough resistance to hold the jack, but if it wants to fall out, bend its lugs slightly so they grab onto the PCB more securely, or use some blue putty to hold it in place.

<p>
  If you need a power supply search for "<em>9V center negative DC supply</em>." There are fancy multi-bank isolated power supplies for pedal boards, but unless you know you need one, just start with an inexpensive wall plug (approximately $10).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Check the results carefully</strong> since most consumer electronics devices use a <em>center positive</em> supply. Guitar pedals are a strange outlier, utilizing <em>center negative</em>.

<p>
Batteries have fallen out of favor for guitar pedals. In most circumstances, they're less convenient, more wasteful, and worse for the planet.  In some cases, though, they are useful or even essential. As such your jack PCB has the option to install a battery clip <small>(not included)</small>. Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects/">the support forum</a> if you need help with this.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, just ignore the "BATT+" and "BATT-" pads.

<h6><em>Power Supplies</em></h6>
<p>
Power supplies have a specific polarity, but jacks do not.
</p>

<p>
A 9V center negative power supply, as is needed for most guitar pedals, has a plug whose outer barrel is 9V higher than its inner barrel. The lower voltage is what we traditionally choose to be our GND <small>("ground")</small> reference. i.e., All other voltages in our pedal will be refered to with respect to voltage on the center barrel of the power supply plug.
</p>
<p>It's commonly referred to as "center negative," though it's not really "negative" per se. It's simply the lower of the two voltage potentials.</p>

<h6><em>DC Jacks</em></h6>
<p>The jack, on the other hand, doesn't have any inherent polarity. It just has a connector for the outer sleeve, a connector for the inner one, and solder lugs or pins for these connectors. <em>You choose</em> which nets <small>(series of connections in your circuit)</small> these parts of the jack connect to. For our foot switch PCB the center pin connects to our GND and the outer barrel connects to diode to provide the +9V VCC.</p>

<p>This foot switch PCB is pre-configured to make all this seamless, but if you were wiring a DIY pedal from scratch as most people do, it's important to get this part right. You would refer to the jack's datasheet to see which connectors are which.</p>

<h6><em>Batteries</em></h6>
<p>Some DC jacks, including this one, have a 3rd connector on them which acts as a switch. When a barrel plug is inserted, the switch disconnects from one of the other two connectors <small>(the outer barrel on this jack)</small>.</p>
<p>We use this so that the battery's positive terminal is connected <em>through the switch</em> to the diode which supplies the +9V side of our circuit. The battery's negative terminal is always connected to our GND. When no barrel plug is inserted, the battery is powering the pedal.
</p>
<p>When a power supply plug is inserted, the switch is disconnected and there is no longer a complete circuit for the battery <small>(loop for the current to go from one side of the battery to the other)</small> and it no longer power the pedal.</p>
