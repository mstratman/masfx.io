First, remove the pedal from the enclosure and check every solder joint carefully.  Each should have a smooth concave dome shape as shown to the right.
</p>

<p>
Most bad solder joints can be fixed easily by <strong>applying more heat to reflow the joint</strong>. Clean and tin your soldering iron, then touch the joint and watch the solder flow over the pad and the component, about 1-3 seconds, then let it cool.
</p>

<p>
If necessary, you may need to add additional solder when heating.
</p>

<p>
After this you can <strong>test it again</strong> before putting it back in the enclosure. Just be sure the PCBs are sitting on non-conductive surfaces (i.e. almost anything but metal).
