<h3>Bypass is fine, LED works, but no sound when engaged</h3>
<div class="float-md ms-3 mb-3">

</div>
<p>If you can hear your clean tone when the pedal is bypassed, but you hit the foot switch, the LED comes on but no sound gets through, your input and output <strong>cables may be reversed</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Ensure your INPUT is on the right,  OUTPUT is on the left.
