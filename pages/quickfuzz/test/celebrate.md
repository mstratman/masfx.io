You just earned your DIY Pedals MERIT BADGE! **Wear or display it proudly!** <small>(Tip: double sided tape is great if you don't want to sew it)</small>

## Show Off Your New Pedal
 
Post your new pedal to [reddit.com/r/maseffects](https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects/) and [r/diypedals](https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals) to show it off and inspire others. Post it everywhere else too! <small>(FB, IG, DIY forums, etc)</small>

Or if that's not really your thing, send some pics to me ([mark@mas-effects.com](mailto:mark@mas-effects.com)) and I'll post them for you <small>(unless you ask me not to)</small>.

**I love to see what you build, please don't be shy!**
