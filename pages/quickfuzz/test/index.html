    <p>Plug in a 2.1mm ,9V, center negative power supply <small>(not included)</small> in the middle jack.</p>
    <p>Plug a 1/4" TS <small>(mono)</small> instrument cable into your guitar, and plug the other end into the right input jack on the pedal.</p>
    <p>Plug another 1/4" TS <small>(mono)</small> instrument cable into the left output jack of the pedal, and plug the other end into your amplifier.</p>
    <p>Leave your other pedals out of the signal chain for now, to remove any other variables.</p>

    <p>Turn the pedal's volume knob to the center position and give it a try. You should hear a clean signal when the LED is off <small>(effect is bypassed)</small>, and a distorted sound when the LED is on.</p>
    <p>If you have any problems, don't panic! It's probably a boneheaded mistake <small>(e.g. reversed cables)</small>, a bad solder joint <small>(easily fixable)</small>, or a misplaced component <small>(a bit more challenging, but you can handle it)</small>. <a href="/quickfuzz/troubleshooting/">Jump to the next chapter for help tackling this</a>.</p>
