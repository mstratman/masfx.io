If you have any questions or problems, <strong>head over to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maseffects" target="_blank">reddit.com/r/maseffects, our support forum</a></strong> and create a new post.
  Usually you'll want to include pictures of your build in addition to a brief description of the trouble you're having. This is the preferred and quickest way to get your problem resolved.
</p>

<p><strong>It's not just for help</strong>, though. Feel free to also post in-progress reports, show off your new pedal when it's completed, or start a discussion on anything you think other pedal builders would enjoy.</p>

<p>Other DIY pedal communities such as
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals">r/diypedals</a>,
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum">diystompboxes.com</a>,
  or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freestompboxes.org">freestompboxes.org</a>
  are great too, but you'll need to provide them with additional context like a schematic and links to the build docs.
  It'll be quicker to use our forum, but bookmark these others since they're great communities.
</p>

<p>Finally, if none of that works for you, <a target="_blank" href="https://mas-effects.com/contact">send an email</a>.</p>

[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="note" heading="Why Reddit?" %]
<p>Reddit offers a more visual experience compared to traditional forums. This is perfect for sharing completed pedals, or pics of PCBs when you're having a problem. It also has built-in support for getting notified when people reply, has native mobile apps, and is free.</p>
<p>
  It's a great platform for niche communities. For example you may also enjoy:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals">r/diypedals</a>,
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals">r/guitarpedals</a>,
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diyelectronics">r/diyelectronics</a>,
  or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diytubes">r/diytubes</a>.

  I DO NOT, however, recommend using its popular subreddits <small>(i.e., anything you find on its main page, r/all, or r/popular)</small> which are often toxic.
