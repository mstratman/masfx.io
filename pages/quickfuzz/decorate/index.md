If you have the *plain aluminum enclosure* with no design, rather than a powder coated and UV-printed one, this would be a good time to decorate it. **The guts of the pedal are designed for easy removal**. Remove all the nuts and washers and pull everything out.

There are countless options to consider. Get creative:

- **Face plate**: Your kit probably came with a face plate you can use to label the knobs. Just remove the nuts and washers from the potentiometers, place the face plate over them, then secure the nuts and washers. [You can also order a custom face plate](https://shop.mas-effects.com/collections/diy/products/custom-faceplate-for-diy-guitar-pedals-and-amps)!
- **Paint**: Spray paint, paint markers, or even brushed paint are all popular ways to decorate DIY pedals
- **Water-slide decals**: You can get professional looking results with a little patience and good techniques
- **Stickers**: Slap some stickers on it for some easy color and style
- **Ink stamps**: Rubber stamps and solvent-based ink (e.g., StazOn) work great. If you mess up, just wipe it off with acetone and try again
- **Sharpie**: Permanent markers can work in a pinch. They won't be as vibrant as paint markers, but they get the job done
- **Label maker**: Old-school punch type, or modern label printers give you quick and easy-to-read labels for your knobs
- **Stamped labels**: Metal letter stamps, a 1x2x3 block (or other anvil), and a hammer and you'll be looking like Fairfield Circuitry in no time
- **Newspaper and magazine clippings**: Bring back your inner 5-year-old with some scissors and a glue stick. If you want to get fancy, you can even use epoxy (e.g., Mod Podge) to ensure it stands up to use and abuse
