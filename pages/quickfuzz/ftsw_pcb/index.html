<h2 id="startthefootswitchpcb">Start the Foot Switch PCB</h2>

<p>Find the foot switch PCB, which has a 3x3 grid of pads for the lugs on the foot switch.</p>
<p>We are going to <em>start</em> <strong>but NOT finish</strong> this PCB, so don't jump ahead! Namely we aren't yet ready to attach the foot switch or the LED, and we'll instead attach those after they're mounted in the enclosure. <small>(Really you <em>could</em> do them now, but the foot switch would be bulky to deal with in the intermediate steps, and the LED's height and spacing would be hard to get right).</small></p>

<h2 id="startthefootswitchpcb">Solder Current Limiting Resistor (CLR) for LED</h2>

<p><strong>Solder R3</strong> just as you did the resistors on the main PCB.</p>



[% WRAPPER "callout.html" type="note" heading="WHAT DOES IT DO?" %]
<p>
  <strong>LED:</strong> lights up when the foot switch routes current through it
</p>
<p>
  <strong>R3:</strong> limits the amount of current available to the LED, to prevent it from burning out. You will often see this called a CLR <small>(Current Limiting Resistor)</small>. Some pedal bills of material won't provide a value for it since you can size it to your taste.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Customization tip</em>: For a dimmer LED, try a larger value for R3 <small>(not included)</small> such as 10k or even 20k. To make it brighter, you can use a small value, e.g. between 220Ω and 1kΩ. We are using a common, moderate value of 4.7kΩ.
